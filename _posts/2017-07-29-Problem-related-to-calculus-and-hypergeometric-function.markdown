# Question 

Prove $${\large\int}_0^\infty\left({_2F_1}\left(\frac16,\frac12;\frac13;-x\right)\right)^{12}dx\stackrel{\color{#808080}?}=\frac{80663}{153090}$$

<!–-break-–>


I discovered the following conjectured identity numerically (it holds with at least $$1000$$ digits of precision). How can I prove it?

 $$ 
{\large\int}_0^\infty\left({_2F_1}\left(\frac16,\frac12;\frac13;-x\right)\right)^{12}dx\stackrel{\color{#808080}?}=\frac{80663}{153090}
 $$ 


Update: It looks like this hypergeometric function assumes algebraic values at algebraic points (it's only a guess because I have only approximations to those algebraic numbers). Looking at those values, I was able to further conjecture that the hypergeometric function for $$x<0$$ is actually the following elementary function:

 $$ 

{_2F_1}\left(\frac16,\frac12;\frac13;x\right)\stackrel{\color{#808080}?}=
\\
\frac1{\sqrt[4]2\sqrt3}\cdot\sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{1-x}+\frac{1}{\alpha}
\sqrt{\frac{4\left(\alpha\sqrt{2}+2\right)+x\left(\sqrt[3]{4\beta}-2\left(\alpha\sqrt{2}+4\right)\right)+2\sqrt[3]{2\beta^2}}{1-x}}}~,

 $$ 

where

 $$ 
\alpha=\sqrt{2-2x+\sqrt[3]{2\beta^2}}~,\qquad\beta=x(x-1)~.
 $$ 

.

# Answer 


Consider the hypergeometric equation with parameters $$(a,b,c)=\left(\frac16,\frac12,\frac13\right)$$, and build from its two canonical solutions near $$z=0$$ the vector

 $$ 
\vec{y}(z)=\left(\begin{array*}{c}
y_1 \\ y_2
\end{array*}\right)=\left(\begin{array*}{c}
_2F_1(a,b;c;z) \\ z^{1-c}{}_2F_1(a-c+1,b-c+1;2-c;z)
\end{array*}\right).\tag{1}
 $$ 

This is a single-valued vector function on $$\mathbb{C}\backslash\{(-\infty,0]\cup[1,\infty)\}$$. Its analytic continuation along a closed loop $$\gamma$$ gives rise to monodromy representation of $$\pi_1(\mathbb{C}\backslash\{0,1\})$$:

 $$ 
 \gamma\mapsto M_{[\gamma]},\qquad y(\gamma z)=M_{[\gamma]}y(z).
 $$ 

The monodromy group $$G\subset GL(2,\mathbb{C})$$ of the hypergeometric equation is generated by two matrices corresponding to simple loops around $$0$$ and $$1$$. In the case we are interested in these matrices are explicitly given by

 $$ 
M_0=\left(\begin{array*}{cc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & e^{-2\pi i /3}\end{array*}\right),\qquad
M_1=C\left(\begin{array*}{cc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & e^{2\pi i /3}\end{array*}\right)C^{-1},\tag{2}
 $$ 

where the connection matrix $$C=\left(\begin{array*}{cc} 1 & 2^{\frac43} \\ -2^{\frac83} & 8\end{array*}\right)$$. If $$G$$ is finite, then $$\vec{y}(z)$$ has a finite number of branches, and moreover (Schwarz 1872), is algebraic. 
It is not difficult to check that the monodromy group $$G$$ generated by $$M_0$$, $$M_1$$ from (2) is indeed finite. In particular, note that

 $$ 
M_0^3=M_1^3=I,\qquad M_1^2=-M_0M_1M_0, 
 $$ 
 
 $$ 
M_1M_0M_1=-M_0^2,\qquad M_1M_0^2M_1=M_0^2M_1M_0^2.
 $$ 
 
It turns out that $$G$$ has order $$24$$ and is isomorphic to the binary tetrahedral group:

 $$ 
G\cong 2T=\langle s,t\,\mid {} \,(st)^2=s^3=t^3\rangle, 
 $$ 

where the generators can be identified as $$s=M_0M_1M_0M_1M_0$$, $$t=M_1M_0M_1M_0M_1$$.
Corollary: The hypergeometric functions in (1) are algebraic.

Algebraic solutions of the hypergeometric equations are classified by the so-called Schwarz table, and have been studied by many mathematicians, see e.g. the bibliography in this paper by R.Vidunas. Their explicit construction is somewhat involved but relatively straightforward - at least when the corresponding algebraic curve has genus $$0$$ (the genus can be determined independently from the Riemann-Hurwitz formula). 
In our case the task simplifies even more as our parameter values can be obtained from the genus $$0$$ tetrahedral formula (2.4) of the above mentioned paper by a combination of a linear trasformation (sending $$\frac56$$ to $$\frac43-\frac56=\frac12$$) and differentiation (transforming $$\frac43$$ into $$\frac13$$). The result is

 $$ 
_2F_1\left(\frac16,\frac12;\frac13;-\frac{r(r+2)^3}{(r+1)(1-r)^3}\right)=\frac{\sqrt{1-r^2}}{2r+1}.
 $$ 

Corollary: The antiderivative $$\displaystyle\int \mathcal{R}\left(x,y(x)\right)dx$$, where $$y(x)={}_2F_1\left(\frac16,\frac12;\frac13;-x\right)$$ and $$\mathcal{R}(x,y)$$ is rational in both arguments, can be expressed in terms of elementary functions.

Example:
The transformation $$r\mapsto x(r)=\frac{r(r+2)^3}{(r+1)(1-r)^3}$$ bijectively maps $$(0,1)$$ to $$(0,\infty)$$, and therefore the initial integral becomes

$$
\begin{align*}\mathcal{I}&=\int_0^1 \left(\frac{\sqrt{1-r^2}}{2r+1}\right)^{12}\left(\frac{r(r+2)^3}{(r+1)(1-r)^3}\right)'dr=\\&=
2\int_0^1 \frac{(1+r)^4(1-r)^2(r+2)^2}{(2r+1)^{10}} dr=\\&=\frac{80\,663}{153\,090}.
\end{align*}
$$
