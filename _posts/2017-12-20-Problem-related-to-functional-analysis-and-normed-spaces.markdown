# Question 

Explicit norm on $$\mathcal{C}^0(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$$

<!–-break-–>


Do you know an explicit norm on $$\mathcal{C}^0(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$$? Using the axiom of choice, every vector space admits a norm but have you an explicit formula on  $$\mathcal{C}^0(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$$?
A related question is: Can we proved that $$\mathcal{C}^0(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$$ has a norm without the axiom of choice?
.


# Answer 


The answer is no.  There is no explicit norm on $$\mathcal{C}^0(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$$; constructing any norm on this space requires the axiom of choice to be used in an essential way.
In my answer to the (newer) question Inner product on $$C(\mathbb R)$$, we show that it is consistent with ZF+DC that there does not exist a norm on the vector space $$\mathcal{C}^0(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$$ (called $$C(\mathbb{R})$$ in that question).
