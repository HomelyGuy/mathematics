# Question 

Set of continuity points of a real function

<!–-break-–>


we have a question about subsets 

$$


A \subseteq \mathbb R


$$


for which there exists a function 

$$

f : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R

$$

 such that the set of continuity points of $$f$$ is $$A$$.
 Can we characterize this kind of sets? In a topological,measurable or in some way? For example, does there exist a function continuous on $$\mathbb Q$$ and discontinuous on the irrationals? 
.


# Answer 


At Pete L. Clark's suggestion, we are  making a comment of mine into an answer.
For those interested in precise references in the published literature for this result (and related results), see
http://groups.google.com/group/sci.math/msg/05dbc0ee4c69898e
we may repost that older post here, perhaps with additions that we didn't know about then (if we happen find any additional references in my stuff at home), but it'll take at least a day or two before we can correctly format all of that older post for posting here.
