# Question 

Can we always establish whether an infinite series converges or diverges?

<!–-break-–>


we are  currently working with infinite series for my calculus class, and we are  wondering whether we always (in theory) can establish whether a series is divergent or convergent? Of course, it might be computationally hard, but are there a class of series where we simply lack the tools to determine whether the series converges or diverges?
.

# Answer 


we are  not sure whether this is what you want or not. Consider the series $$\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$$, with

$$

a_n=\begin{cases}1&\text{ if }2^n-1\text{ is prime}\\0&\text{ otherwise.}\end{cases}

$$

It is not known whether it converges or not.
