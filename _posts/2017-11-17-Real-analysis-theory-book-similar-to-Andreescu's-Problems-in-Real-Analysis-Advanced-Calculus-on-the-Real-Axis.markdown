# Question 

Real analysis “theory book” similar to Andreescu's Problems in Real Analysis: Advanced Calculus on the Real Axis

<!–-break-–>


we are  going through Andreescu et al.
,Problems in Real Analysis: Advanced Calculus on the Real Axis and we are  very impressed: the style of the book seems really modern and the material covered includes many theorems, examples, etc.
 that are rarely or not at all seen in other books (both theory books and problem books) and that are often taken from not well-known sources or from recent issues of math journals.
 

we was wondering if there is a "theory book" that resembles the one I
  mentioned (and roughly covers the same material)?

.


# Answer 


we have  seen the book you mention before, but it's been over a year, so we don't recall exactly the nature of the material you're seeking - rare stuff not in other books, or material covered in books like Rudin/Ross? 
If you're looking for creative/nonstandard "Putnam" questions over the standard material (which we believe is the nature of the book you mention), try the three volume "Problems in Mathematical Analysis" series by Kaczor and Nowak. Lang's "Undergraduate Analysis" (with accompanying solution manual by Shakarchi) also covers some "beyond the box" material.
