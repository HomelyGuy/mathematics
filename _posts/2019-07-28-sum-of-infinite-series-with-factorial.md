# Question

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma _{n=1} ^{ \infty } \frac{n+2}{n!+(n+1)!+(n+2)!}
\end{equation*}
$$

<!–-break-–>

Have you ever come across the infinite sum such as  

$$ \Sigma _{n=1} ^{ \infty } \frac{1}{(n-1)! (n+1)} \,\, \text{or} \,\, \Sigma _{n=1} ^{ \infty } \frac{1}{(n-1)! + n! }$$

the trick lies in that  

$$
\label{trick}
\begin{equation} 
\frac{1}{(n-1)! (n+1)} = \frac{n}{(n+1)!} = \frac{n+1 - 1}{(n+1)!} = (n!)^{-1} - (n+1)!^{-1}
\end{equation}
$$

This question is the extention of formula $$\ref{trick}$$, since  

$$
\label{tric}
\begin{equation}
\frac{n+2}{n!+(n+1)!+(n+2)! = \frac{n+2}{n!( 1+ n+1 (n+1) (n+2) ) } = \frac{1}{n!(n+2)} 
\end{equation}
$$


Now we can handle it with ease combing formula $$\ref{trick}$$ and $$\ref{tric}$$. I will leave the rest 
proof to you. (If you get $$\frac{1}{2}$$ congratulations, if not, one more try.)
