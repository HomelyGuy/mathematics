# Question 

Need a hint: show that a subset $$E \subset \mathbb{R}$$ with no limit points is at most countable.

<!–-break-–>


we are  stuck on the following real-analysis problem and could use a hint:
Consider $$\mathbb{R}$$ with the standard metric.
 Let $$E \subset \mathbb{R}$$ be a subset which has no limit points.
 Show that $$E$$ is at most countable.
 
we are  primarily confused about how to go about showing that this set $$E$$ is at most countable (i.
e.
 finite or countable).

What we can show: since $$E$$ has no limit points, we can show that for every $$x \in E$$, there is a neighborhood $$N_{r_x}(x)$$ where $$r_x > 0$$ that does not contain any other point $$y \in E$$ where $$y \neq x$$.
 This suffices to show that every point within x is an isolated point.
 
.


# Answer 


Hint. $$\mathbb{Q}$$ is dense in $$\mathbb{R}$$. Say there is an uncountable set without limit points. How is $$\mathbb{Q}$$ shared in their neighborhoods?
