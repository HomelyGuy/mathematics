# Question 

Is there an algorithm to determine whether a series converges?

<!–-break-–>


we thought of this question in connection with Calculus Iwe (a course in the US which includes, among other things, techniques of integration and convergence tests for series, both of which are taught as a bunch of techniques that might work for a particular problem) but feel free to make the answers as complicated as necessary. The question of whether an elementary antiderivative of an elementary function $$f(x)$$ exists is answered by the Risch algorithm and we want to ask a similar question about convergence of series.
Let $$f(x)$$ be an elementary function and $$a_n=f(n)$$ for $$n=0,1,2,\ldots$$.

# Answer 


If such an algorithm would exist at the moment then we will know whether the series 


$$


\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^3\sin^2 n}


$$


converges. But it is not, for details see this answer.
