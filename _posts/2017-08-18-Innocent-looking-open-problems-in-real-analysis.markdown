# Question 

Innocent looking open problems in real analysis

<!–-break-–>


Are there any apparently easy problems or conjectures in basic real analysis (that is, calculus) that are still open? By apparently easy, we mean: so much so, that, if it was for the statement alone, they could be part of a calculus book for undergraduates?
.

# Answer 


Look for questions marked as open-problem or open-problem-list on mathoverflow. we guess you will find some open problems there.
Here a list of some open questions i have found there:

Convergence of a series and this question
Gourevitch's conjecture
Cover of the unit square by rectangles
...
