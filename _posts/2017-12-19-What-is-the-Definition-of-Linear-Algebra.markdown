# Question 

What is the Definition of Linear Algebra?

<!–-break-–>


For introducing a field of science, usually we require a definition which summarizes the goal which is intended to be achieved by this field.
 Linear Algebra is one of the most important parts of mathematics which has not only interesting pure mathematical ideas but also a lot of applications in physics and engineering.
 So it seems reasonable to have a Complete, Clear, Brief, and Delicate definition for this important branch of mathematics.
 
we are  wondering that what is the best fit for such a definition.
 For example, the very first sentence that the Linear Algebra Done Right by Sheldon Axler starts with is 

Linear Algebra is the study of linear maps on finite dimensional vector spaces.


What is your definition of Linear Algebra in few sentences?  
.


# Answer 


Essentially all of the major parts of abstract algebra have the same definition.
[X Theory] is the study of [sets with the structure X] and the [whatever homomorphisms are called in this subject] between them.
For example:
Linear Algebra is the study of vector spaces and the linear maps between them.
Group Theory is the study of groups and the group homomorphisms between them.
Lattice Theory is the study of lattices and the lattice homomorphisms between them.


**Note** that as usual in math, the definitions themselves don't tell you very much.  You have to actually study these topics to understand, for instance what a vector space is, what a linear map is, and why these ideas are useful.
