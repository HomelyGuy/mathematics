# Question 

Irrationality of $$\pi^2$$ and $$\pi^3$$

<!–-break-–>


we wonder if there is any book and/or article you can recommend on the topic "Irrationality of $$\pi^2$$ and $$\pi^3$$" for me to study on.
 In case you are curious about why we ask these particular exponents, it's because this is a project that my lecturer gave me to study on and then present to the class what we have  got on this topic
PS: we do not understand why people vote for my post to be closed 
.


# Answer 


The following references are mostly specific to your question:
[1] Adrien-Marie Legendre, Éléments de Géométrie, avec des notes, Firmin Didot (Paris), 1794, xii + 334 pages.

A proof of the irrationality of $${\pi}^2$$ by the use of continued fractions is given on p. 304.

[2] James Whitbread Lee Glaisher, On Lambert’s proof of the irrationality of $$\pi,$$ and on the irrationality of certain other quantities, pp. 12-16 in Notices and Abstracts of Miscellaneous Communications to the Sections, Report of the Forty-First Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (August 1871, Edinburgh), John Murray (London), 1872.

The paper is on “.pdf pages” 341-345 of this google books item. The top third of p. 14 discusses Legendre’s proof that $${\pi}^2$$ is irrational.

[3] Charles Hermite, Extrait d'une lettre de Mr. Ch. Hermite à Mr. Borchardt [Extract of a letter of Mr. Ch. Hermite to Mr. Borchardt], Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik 76 (1873), pp. 342-344.

Hermite shows $${\pi}^2$$ is irrational by a method that avoids the use of continued fractions --- a method that very soon afterwards led to his proof that $$e$$ is transcendental.

If you can read German (we can’t), we believe this could be of use. Lambert’s proof that $${\pi}^2$$ is irrational is mentioned on p. 326 (line 9).

From MR0033299 (11,418a) review by Jan Popkin: By considering a larger class of similar integrals the author intends to obtain more general results. He gives applications by showing in this manner the irrationality of such numbers as 
$${\pi}^2,\log A, (A \neq 1) e^A,$$ 

where $$A$$ denotes a positive integer. [The paper contains some misprints and other mistakes; the most serious one at the end of § 6, where the quantity $$M$$ introduced depends on $$n.$$ In view of various papers giving generalizations of Niven's method it is perhaps of interest to remark that there exists a close connection between this method and the classical proofs for the irrationality of $$\pi$$ and $${\pi}^2$$ of Lambert, Hermite and others. Take for instance the integral $$[\cdots]$$

In Chapter 16, Theorem 1 (stated and proved on pp. 323-324) is the irrationality of $${\pi}^2.$$ This same result probably appears in either or both earlier editions (1967, 1980), but we have not verified this.

1) In this note we take a new look at the classic analytic irrationality proofs for $${\pi}^2$$ and the integer powers of $$e,$$ showing that the required approximation polynomials are generated by one single integral expression. Our approach makes it obvious how the polynomials come into existence, why they have integer coefficients and that the irrationality proofs for $${\pi},$$ $${\pi}^2$$ and $$e^k$$ are only different special cases derived from the same general formula.
