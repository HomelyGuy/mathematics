# Question 

Two monotone functions which equal on rational numbers

<!–-break-–>


Let $$f,g:\mathbb R\to \mathbb R$$ be increasing and $$f(r)=g(r)$$ for every $$r\in\mathbb Q$$.
 Must we have $$f(x)=g(x)$$ for every $$x\in\mathbb R$$? 
Thanks in advance!
.


# Answer 


No. Take 

$$

f(x)=x+\chi_{(\pi,+\infty)}(x)\,,\ \ \ g(x)=x+\chi_{[\pi,+\infty)}(x).

$$


Here $$\chi_A$$ stands for the indicator function of the set $$A$$; i.e. $$\chi_A$$ is the function whose value at $$x$$ is $$1$$ if $$x\in A$$, and $$0$$ otherwise.
